1.  **Set Your Schedule:** Choose one or more times each day for the app to check in with you (e.g., 9 AM and 10 PM).
2.  **Confirm You're Safe:** When it's time, you'll get a notification. A single tap on the "I'm Safe" button is all it takes.
3.  **Automatic Alerts:** If you don't respond within your chosen time window (e.g., 15 minutes), your emergency contacts will automatically receive an SMS notification letting them know you've missed a check-in.
