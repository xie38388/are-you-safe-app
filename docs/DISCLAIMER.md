# Disclaimer for "Are You Safe?"

**Last Updated: January 12, 2025**

This disclaimer outlines the limitations of the "Are You Safe?" application ("the App"). By using the App, you acknowledge and agree to the terms of this disclaimer.

## 1. Not an Emergency Service

"Are You Safe?" is **NOT a substitute for emergency services like 911, a professional medical alert system, or any form of professional monitoring.** The App is intended as a supplementary tool for personal peace of mind and is not designed for use in life-threatening situations. In the event of an emergency, you must contact your local emergency services immediately.

## 2. No Guarantee of Notification Delivery

The App relies on third-party services, including push notifications and SMS (text message) providers (e.g., Twilio), as well as public mobile and internet networks. The delivery of these notifications is **not guaranteed** and can be subject to delays, failures, or blockages due to factors beyond our control, such as:

- Network congestion or outages
- Your device being turned off, in airplane mode, or having no signal
- Incorrect or outdated contact information
- SMS filtering by mobile carriers
- Do Not Disturb settings on your or your contacts' devices

We are not responsible or liable for any non-delivery, delayed delivery, or mis-delivery of any alert or notification.

## 3. User Responsibility

It is your sole responsibility to:

- Ensure your device has adequate battery power and network connectivity.
- Respond to check-in prompts in a timely manner.
- Provide accurate and up-to-date phone numbers for your emergency contacts.
- Obtain consent from your contacts before adding them to the App and inform them about how the service works.

## 4. No Medical or Safety Advice

The App does not provide medical, safety, or legal advice. It does not monitor your health, location, or physical condition. It only tracks whether you have interacted with a prompt in the App.

## 5. Limitation of Liability

By using this App, you agree that the creators and operators of "Are You Safe?" are not liable for any injury, loss, or damage—whether direct, indirect, incidental, or consequential—that may arise from your use or inability to use the App. This includes, but is not limited to, damages resulting from a failure to send or receive a notification.

## 6. As-Is Service

The App is provided on an "as is" and "as available" basis without any warranties, express or implied, including but not limited to the implied warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, or non-infringement.

Your use of the "Are You Safe?" app signifies your understanding and acceptance of these limitations.
