## 2. Data Storage and Security

We implement industry-standard security measures to protect your data:

- **Local Encryption**: Your emergency contacts, including their names and phone numbers, are stored on your device in an encrypted format (AES-256-GCM). Contact names are never transmitted to our servers.

- **Secure Infrastructure**: All backend services and databases are hosted on Cloudflare's secure, globally distributed network.
- **Secure Transmission**: All communication between the app and our servers is encrypted using HTTPS/TLS.

## 3. Data Sharing

We do not sell, trade, or rent your personal information to third parties. We only share data with the following essential service providers:

- **Twilio**: If you enable SMS alerts, we share your contacts' phone numbers with Twilio to facilitate the sending of SMS messages. We do not share contact names.
- **Cloudflare**: We use Cloudflare for our backend infrastructure, including hosting our API and database.

We may also disclose information if required by law or in response to valid requests by public authorities.

## 4. Data Retention

We retain your data only as long as necessary to provide the service:

- **Check-in History**: Retained for a rolling period of 90 days.
